# Linear-and-Logistic-Regression
An end-to-end study of Linear and Logistic regression with the Diamonds and Heart dataset on Kaggle

1. Diamond Dataset: Predict the price of the diamonds

Import the diamond dataset from kaggle  
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)  
Check for null or missing values  
Check numeric and non-numeric attributes  
Observe the value of x, y, z  
Plot histogram, pair plot, heatmap  
Convert non-numeric(categorical) data into numeric  
Extract X as all columns except the price column and Y as the price column  
Split the data into a training set and testing set  
Perform 10-fold cross-validation  
Train a Linear regression model for the dataset  
Compute the accuracy  
Visualize training and test results  

2. Health care dataset: Predict the possibility of heart attack (The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer-valued 0 = no/less chance of heart attack and 1 = more chance of heart attack)

Import health care dataset from kaggle  
Extract X as all columns except the target column and Y as the target column  
Visualize the dataset using any two appropriate graphs  
Visualize the correlation between all the variables of a dataset  
Split the data into a training set and testing set  
Perform 10-fold cross-validation  
Train a Logistic regression model for the dataset  
Compute the accuracy and confusion matrix  
Plot the decision boundary, visualize training and test results
